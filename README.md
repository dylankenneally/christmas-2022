# Christmas cards - 2022

Christmas cards made for friends &amp; family.

Features a simple CSS based animation of a card opening/closing on click/tap, a present/box CSS animation and snow flakes animations. Clicking/tapping the present/box reveals a three.js snowball game.

## Usage

To use the card in the future, replace `INSERT_NAME` with the name of the person you want to send the card to in [`index.html`](./index.html) and deploy the full directory tree somewhere. There's no build step required.

You'll also want to replace `2022` with the current year in the same file, and in [`snowball-toy/index.html`](./snowball-toy/index.html).
